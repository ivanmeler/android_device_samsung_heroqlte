## TODO
- fp delete 
- volume control for notif., mixers or something related
- check init for missing perms and stuff which might help fix remaining issues
- consider libbt-vendor from stock/or check fw/config for stability
- camera lib should be edited for pthread, for now use bionic patch, also look into shim we use
- tethering/dual role doesnt forward internet
- imporove audio
- use more s7 blobs
- check init
- notif led (might need init.rc changes)
- nfc
- perf tuning
- Dual sim, which needs s7 ril blobs
- update to newer android version
